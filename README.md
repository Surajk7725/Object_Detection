# Object_Detection

Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and locating objects within an image or video stream. One popular approach for object detection is using the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) architecture with the MobileNetV3 backbone, combined with the OpenCV library for implementation.

Please visit the website to download both the weights (by left-clicking on **Open Link in New Tab**) and the configuration file for MobileNet-SSD v3,(see #16760)
